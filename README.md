# News Feed

News Feed was built in 3 days, as part of a two-person collaborative project to create a React app that consumes 3rd party API data from News API.  
Users can browse and search for news, and store preferences to build their own personalised news feed

## Live version
Please note that because of restrictions placed on the API key by News API, there is currently no live version of this project; however, to see it in action, you can follow the installation instructions below. Alternatively, you can see a live version of News Feed v2Global, which is similar in functionality to News Feed, but consumes data from GNews, https://gnews.io/ (rather than News API):
* News Feed v2Global:
  * live version: https://the-news-feed-v2-global.netlify.app
  * repo: https://github.com/Simon994/news-feed-v2Global
